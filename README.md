# Picture Naming

## Description

Purpose of this experiment is to test how quickly participants can name
presented pictures. For each trial a cue is given. The cue is the national
flag of the Netherlands or England. The cue determines whether the response
should be in English or Dutch. A picture is presented on the screen
together with the flag.
Participant's task is to name each picture. Auto-paced. Output: audio recording.

## limitations and analysis
This implementation doesn't measure naming latencies. These have to 
be measured off-line. The script produces a beep at onset of visual 
stimulus. Experimenter should make sure the participant's speech 
signal and the beep signal are both fed into the computer.
